# SFML-TicTacToe
TicTacToe made using C++ and SFML

It has a basic version, with minimum features for the tictactoe game.

The full version just has a bit more, with quirks, insults, and a *"surprise"*, which I made just to mess with my friends a little.

I made this a long time ago and decided to upload today, pls don't judge my shitty jokes or code style. Or do, I might still learn something.
